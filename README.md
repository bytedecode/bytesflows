## What is Bytesflows?

**Bytesflows** provides **dynamic residential proxies** — real household IPs that rotate per request or per session so your scrapers look like normal users. That means fewer blocks, better success on protected sites, and the ability to scale.

- **Rotating residential IPs** — Lower block rates than datacenter proxies; ideal for Cloudflare and other anti-bot environments
- **Geo-targeting** — Choose country or city for local prices, inventory, SERP, and region-specific data
- **Free tools** — [Proxy Checker](https://bytesflows.com/en/blog/proxy-checker), [Scraping Test](https://bytesflows.com/en/blog/scraping-test), [User-Agent Generator](https://bytesflows.com/en/blog/user-agent-generator), [Robots.txt Tester](https://bytesflows.com/en/blog/robots-tester), [Proxy Rotator](https://bytesflows.com/en/blog/proxy-rotator), and more on the site

The content in this repo is written to help you **learn web scraping, choose the right proxies, and run more reliable crawls**. Explore the guides on the live site and try [Bytesflows proxies](https://bytesflows.com/en/proxies) when you’re ready to scale.

```
content/
  blog/       # Long articles (slug → /en/blog/<slug>)
  landing/    # Topic landings (residential-proxies, cloudflare-scraping, python-scraping-proxy)
  tools/      # Tool docs (proxy-checker, scraping-test, etc.)

  fix-internal-links-sitemap.js  # Normalize internal links to /en/blog/... and /en/proxies
  # ... other utilities
```

- **Internal links:** Use only paths that exist on the live sitemap ([bytesflows.com/sitemap.xml](https://bytesflows.com/sitemap.xml)), e.g. `/en/blog/<slug>`, `/en/proxies`. Run `node scripts/fix-internal-links-sitemap.js` to fix old-style links.
- **New posts:** Add a `.md` file under `content/blog/`, `content/landing/`, or `content/tools/` with frontmatter (`title`, `slug`, `summary`, `category`, `tags`, `language`). Then run the upload/sync script as used in your pipeline.
